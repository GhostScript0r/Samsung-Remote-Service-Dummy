This is a dummy app that will block Samsung Smart Tutor App from installing when you click "Remote Service" in Samsung system settings.

This app currently has no launcher icon or any main activity. When you click "Remote Service" on your Samsung device with this dummy installed, the Settings app will crash.

Devs who can add a MainActivity to this app to prevent crashing of the settings app are welcome to improve this project.
